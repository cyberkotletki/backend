# Donly Project Overview

> Donly is a platform that connects donors (subscribers) and streamers. Streamers specify their wishlist, and
subscribers can send funds to support them using smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
> The project includes a mini-app in Telegram with its own frontend, a backend written in Golang, and a Telegram bot
written in Python that communicates with the Golang application via Redis streams. A light mode Geth node will be
deployed for polling data from smart contracts, and traffic will be proxied through Traefik with automatic certificate
management. The database is MongoDB, and MinIO will be used as S3 storage. The entire setup will be orchestrated using
Nomad along with Consul and Vault.
> The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and additions as development progresses.
> For local development, a Docker Compose setup will be provided to simplify the initial stages without involving Nomad,
traefik, or the Geth node. The focus will be on the essential components needed for development.
